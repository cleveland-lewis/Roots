// Project Objective, Success Metrics, and Ethical Boundaries

// Objective
/*
Roots aims to deliver a student-focused productivity dashboard that empowers neurodivergent users and student-athletes by providing zero-choice, energy-aware study recommendations, intelligent scheduling, and rapid access to academic resources. Its core goal: help users know exactly what to do and when, with a minimum of cognitive overhead, using Apple-native privacy and user experience standards.
*/

// Success Metrics
/*
- User Engagement: Frequency and duration of app usage, especially around task execution and focus block completion.
- Completion Rate: Percentage of recommended tasks and study blocks completed by users.
- User Satisfaction: Positive user feedback and lack of feature/UX complaints.
- Reliability: Low crash rate and minimal data sync or loss incidents.
- Privacy and Security: Absence of data breaches or unauthorized leaks; adherence to privacy policies.
- Accessibility: Usage and positive feedback from neurodivergent and accessibility-focused users.
*/

// Ethical Boundaries
/*
- Privacy First: User data is never shared externally without explicit, transparent consent. AI integrations that send data to external servers are clearly disclosed and can be disabled.
- Transparency: Users are warned about what data is processed, how, and where it may be sent (see in-app Settings warnings).
- Non-Coercion: The app never pressures users to reveal sensitive information or participate in unwanted flows. All features are opt-in.
- No Surveillance: No hidden analytics, logging, or third-party tracking. All analytics are local-first and anonymized if used.
- Accessibility Commitment: Design and features prioritize users with cognitive or learning challenges, ensuring equitable access.
- No Academic Dishonesty: The app does not generate, condone, or enable plagiarism, cheating, or inappropriate academic shortcuts.
