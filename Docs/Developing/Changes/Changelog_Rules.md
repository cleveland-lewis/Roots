# `Changelog.md` Rules

- The `changelog.md` records every meaningful change to the project in strict chronological order.
- All entries are grouped under date headers written in ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Entries for each date are organized into the following categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, and Security, in that order.
- Each bullet point must reference a ticket number using the format `TICKET-###`.
- All entries must be written in the third person with clear, technical, and concise language.
- No vague or ambiguous entries are allowed; every bullet must describe a specific action or change.
- Every functional code change must have a corresponding `changelog.md` entry before the ticket is marked completed.
- Each `changelog.md` entry must correspond to updates documented in the associated ticket’s Markdown file.
- All `changelog.md` entries must describe user-visible behavior changes when applicable.
- The `changelog.md` file grows by adding new entries to the top, not the bottom.
- No deletions or rewriting of `changelog.MD history is permitted; corrections are added as new `(Corrected)` lines.
- Each date may include multiple category sections, but categories appear only if they contain at least one entry.
- No ticket can be closed until the `changelog.md` entry is added and verified.
- Any changes to Criticality-3 tickets must be explicitly reflected in the `changelog.md`.
- If a change spans multiple days, each milestone is logged under its respective date.
- All `changelog.md` entries must remain human-readable and formatted strictly in Markdown.
- No bundling of unrelated changes into a single bullet is allowed.
- Every change affecting security, privacy, or data handling must include a dedicated `Security` entry.
- Renaming, restructuring, or refactoring that alters behavior must be documented under `Changed`.
- Deprecated features or removed components must be documented under `Removed`.
