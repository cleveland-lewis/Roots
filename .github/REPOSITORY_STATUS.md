- Developing modifications or derivative works in a fork

**Forking this repository does NOT grant you permission to use, modify, or distribute the code.**

This repository **does not accept pull requests**. Any PRs submitted will be immediately closed.

If you attempt to submit a PR, you will see a template explaining:
- This is not an open source project

- All usage rights are reserved

### Issues

Issues may be enabled for:
- Security vulnerability reporting (though private reporting is preferred)

- Discussions about implementing similar features elsewhere

### Discussions

GitHub Discussions are not enabled and will not be enabled.

## Why Is the Code Visible?

The source code is made available for:

1. **Transparency:** Users can verify data handling, privacy practices, and security
2. **Trust:** Security researchers can audit the codebase
3. **Education:** Developers can learn from implementation patterns (viewing only)
4. **Accountability:** Code quality and practices are open to scrutiny

**Visibility ≠ Permission to Use**

Making source code visible does NOT grant permission to copy, modify, or use it. 
This is fundamentally different from open source software.
